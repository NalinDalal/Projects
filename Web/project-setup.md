# Building a Full-Stack Web Application with React and Node.js
Well organised Structure: Clear seperation of frontend and backend code, along with other relevant directories.
README Documentation: Comprehensive documentation providing instructions for setup, development, testing and deployment,versions,dependencies, env variables etc.

Tests: Suites of test for frontend and backend components,along with clear instructions to run them

## Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

- Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.
- Create a new project directory.

## Step 2: Setting Up the Backend (Node.js)

- Inside the project directory, create a new folder named "server".
- Open a terminal and navigate to the "server" directory.
- Initialize a new Node.js project for the server using the command: `npm init`.
- Create the necessary folders: "models", "controllers", "services", and "routes".

## Step 3: Setting Up the Frontend (React)

- Open a terminal and navigate to the "client" directory.
- Install Vite, a tool for creating React applications, using the command: `npm init vite`.
- Follow the prompts to set up the React app and choose the desired configuration options.
- Create the necessary folders inside the "src" directory: "components", "constants", "assets", "pages", and so on.

## Step 4: Connecting the Backend and Frontend

- In the "server" folder, create the required API routes in the "routes" folder using Express.js.
- In the "client" folder, make HTTP requests to the backend API using libraries like Axios or Fetch API.

## Step 5: Implementing Features

- Identify the features you want to add to your web application (e.g., user authentication, database integration, etc.).
- Implement the desired functionality in the backend by creating appropriate controllers, services, and models.
- Implement the corresponding frontend components and pages that interact with the backend.

## Step 6: Deployment

- Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.) for deploying your application.
- Set up the deployment environment and configure necessary settings.
- Build the React application inside the "client" folder using the command: `npm run build`.
- Deploy the backend and frontend to the hosting platform of your choice.

## Step 7: Continuous Integration and Deployment (optional)

- Set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline using services like GitHub Actions or Travis CI.
- Configure the pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy your application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
- Config files for CI tools like Github actions, specifying workflow for automated testing and deployments.
- Dockerfile for containerizing the application and any additional config files related to Docker.
- Kubernetes manifest or Helm Charts for deploying application on kubernetes cluster.

## Step 8: CI/CD Pipelines Scripts
Scripts or configuration files for setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines, ensuring a smooth and automated deployment process.
